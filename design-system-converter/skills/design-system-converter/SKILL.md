# Design System Converter

Route design system conversion requests to the appropriate target-specific workflow.

## Trigger Phrases

- "convert design system" / "design to code"
- "convert to drupal" / "convert to radix" / "html to drupal"
- "generate theme" / "radix theme"
- "convert html" / "SDC components" / "layout builder"
- NOT for: General design questions, HTML page creation, brand extraction

## Available Targets

| Target | Command | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Drupal Radix/SDC (guided) | `/convert-to-radix` | Available |
| Drupal Radix/SDC (quick) | `/convert-to-radix-quick` | Available |
| Canvas | -- | Planned |
| Next.js | -- | Planned |

## Architecture

The converter uses a two-layer architecture:

1. **Shared analyzer** (`html-to-radix-analyzer`): Parses HTML metadata comments, classifies patterns, extracts design tokens, inventories Drupal backend. Target-agnostic output.
2. **Target-specific generators** (e.g., `radix-sdc-generator`): Consumes analysis output and generates code for a specific platform.

## External Guide Ecosystem

Domain knowledge lives in external guides at `https://camoa.github.io/dev-guides/`. The converter is a thin workflow layer that orchestrates analysis + generation.

**Guide referencing protocol:**
1. WebFetch `https://camoa.github.io/dev-guides/llms.txt` at start of conversion to discover current guide pages
2. WebFetch specific pages on demand as the conversion progresses
3. Never hardcode page URLs -- always discover via llms.txt

**Key guide sections:**
- `design-systems/recognition/` -- Token identification, classification (used by analyzer)
- `design-systems/bootstrap/` -- Token-to-Bootstrap SCSS mapping (used by generator)
- `design-systems/radix-components/` -- Component selection, full API reference (used by both)
- `design-systems/radix-sdc/` -- Sub-theme architecture, SDC development, LB integration (used by generator)
- `drupal/sdc/` -- YAML schema, props/slots, SCSS scoping (used by generator)

## Commands

Route user requests to the appropriate command:

| User Intent | Command |
|-------------|---------|
| Convert with full control | `/convert-to-radix` |
| Quick convert with defaults | `/convert-to-radix-quick` |

## Underlying Skills

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **html-to-radix-analyzer** | Analyze HTML metadata for conversion (bundled) |
| **radix-sdc-generator** | Generate Radix sub-theme with SDC components (bundled) |

## Input Sources

Currently supported:
- **HTML with metadata comments**: Pages generated by brand-content-design plugin with `<!-- component: -->`, `<!-- prop: -->`, `<!-- slot: -->` annotations

Planned:
- **Figma designs**: Direct Figma-to-code conversion
- **Raw HTML**: Inference-based analysis without metadata comments
