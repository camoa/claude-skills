# Brand Init Command

Initialize a new brand project with the required folder structure.

## Workflow

1. **Ask for project name**
   - Use AskUserQuestion: "What is the name of this brand/project?"

2. **Create folder structure**
   Create the following structure in the current directory:

   ```
   {project-name}/
   ├── brand-philosophy.md
   ├── assets/                 # Processed assets ready for use in content
   │   └── (files copied here by /brand-extract or /brand-assets)
   ├── templates/
   │   ├── presentations/
   │   └── carousels/
   ├── presentations/
   ├── carousels/
   └── input/                  # Raw source files
       ├── logos/              # Logo files (SVG, PNG, AI, EPS)
       ├── icons/              # Icon sets, favicons
       ├── images/             # Brand photography, illustrations
       ├── fonts/              # Custom font files (TTF, OTF, WOFF)
       ├── screenshots/        # For brand extraction analysis
       └── documents/          # For brand extraction analysis
   ```

3. **Create placeholder brand-philosophy.md**
   ```markdown
   # Brand Philosophy: {Project Name}

   *This file will be generated by /brand-extract*

   ## To complete setup:
   1. Add brand assets to the input/ folder:
      - Screenshots of website, marketing materials → input/screenshots/
      - PDFs, Word docs with brand content → input/documents/
      - Logo files → input/logos/
   2. Run /brand-extract to analyze and generate brand philosophy
   ```

4. **Confirm completion**
   Tell user:
   - Project folder created successfully
   - Next steps:
     1. Add brand assets to input/ folder
     2. Run `/brand-extract` to analyze and generate brand philosophy
     3. Run `/brand-palette` (optional) to generate alternative color palettes
     4. Run `/template-presentation` or `/template-carousel` to create your first template

## Output

- Created folder: `{project-name}/`
- Created files: brand-philosophy.md (placeholder)
- User instructed on next steps

## Note on Guides

Content type guides (presentations-guide.md, carousels-guide.md) are **not copied** to the project. They are referenced directly from the plugin's `references/` folder when needed. This ensures users always get the latest guide updates.
