# Visual Content Skill

Create gallery-quality branded presentations and carousels through artistic design philosophy.

## The Critical Understanding

Visual content creation is an act of **artistic expression**, not template filling. Every slide or card should appear as if crafted by a designer at the absolute top of their field—meticulous, intentional, worthy of display.

**What you receive**: A canvas philosophy and brand DNA—use these as foundation, not constraint.
**What you create**: Visual artifacts that are 90% design, 10% essential text.
**The standard**: Work that looks like it took countless hours, labored over with painstaking care.

---

## Part 1: Understanding Canvas Philosophy

A canvas philosophy is not a layout specification—it's an **aesthetic movement**, a manifesto for how ideas become visual form.

### How to Read a Canvas Philosophy

When you receive a `canvas-philosophy.md`, internalize its spirit:

- **The movement name** tells you the soul: "Chromatic Silence" demands restraint; "Brutalist Joy" permits boldness
- **The philosophy paragraphs** describe how ideas manifest through form, space, color, composition
- **The constraints** are sacred boundaries that define the style's character

**Read it as an artist reads a creative brief—absorb the worldview, then express it.**

### Philosophy Examples (for reference)

These illustrate the language and depth expected in a canvas philosophy:

**"Concrete Poetry"**
Communication through monumental form and bold geometry. Massive color blocks, sculptural typography (huge single words, tiny labels), Brutalist spatial divisions. Ideas expressed through visual weight and spatial tension, not explanation. Text as rare, powerful gesture—never paragraphs, only essential words integrated into visual architecture. Every element placed with the precision of a master craftsman who has labored over each decision.

**"Chromatic Language"**
Color as the primary information system. Geometric precision where color zones create meaning. Typography minimal—small sans-serif labels letting chromatic fields communicate. Information encoded spatially and chromatically. Words only anchor what color already shows. The result of painstaking chromatic calibration by someone at the top of their field.

**"Analog Meditation"**
Quiet visual contemplation through texture and breathing room. Paper grain, ink bleeds, vast negative space. Photography and illustration dominate. Typography whispered (small, restrained, serving the visual). Images breathe across pages. Text appears sparingly—short phrases, never explanatory blocks. Each composition balanced with the care of a meditation practice, meticulously crafted over countless hours.

**"Geometric Silence"**
Pure order and restraint. Grid-based precision, bold photography or stark graphics, dramatic negative space. Typography precise but minimal—small essential text, large quiet zones. Swiss formalism meets Brutalist material honesty. Structure communicates, not words. Every alignment the work of countless refinements by an expert hand.

---

## Part 2: The Subtle Reference

**CRITICAL STEP**: Before creating visuals, identify the conceptual thread from the content.

The topic becomes a **subtle, niche reference embedded within the design itself**—not literal, always sophisticated. Someone familiar with the subject should feel it intuitively, while others simply experience a masterful composition.

Think like a jazz musician quoting another song—only those who know will catch it, but everyone appreciates the music.

The canvas philosophy provides the aesthetic language. The content provides the soul—the quiet conceptual DNA woven invisibly into form, color, and composition.

---

## Part 3: Visual Expression

With philosophy internalized and conceptual thread identified, create the visual artifacts.

### The Craftsmanship Standard

**CRITICAL**: To achieve human-crafted quality (not AI-generated), create work that looks like it took countless hours. Make it appear as though someone at the absolute top of their field labored over every detail with painstaking care.

Ensure the composition, spacing, color choices, typography—everything screams **expert-level craftsmanship**. This is non-negotiable.

Repeat this mantra:
- Meticulously crafted
- The product of deep expertise
- Painstaking attention to detail
- Master-level execution
- Labored over with care

### Creating Presentations (16:9)

- **Dimensions**: 1920 x 1080 pixels
- **Format**: PDF first (source of truth) → PPTX (for editability)
- **Character**: Each slide = one clear message (3-second test)
- **Text treatment**: Sparse, integrated as visual element—never paragraphs
- **Safe zones**: Nothing within 50px of edges

**The slide is a canvas, not a document.** Information lives in design choices: scale, position, color, whitespace. Words are visual accents, not content delivery.

### Creating Carousels (Mobile-First)

- **LinkedIn**: 1080 x 1350 (4:5 portrait)
- **Instagram Square**: 1080 x 1080 (1:1)
- **Instagram Portrait**: 1080 x 1350 (4:5)
- **Format**: Multi-page PDF
- **Character**: Each card = 2-second comprehension (thumb-stopping)
- **Text treatment**: Bold, scannable, commanding

**The card is a poster glimpsed while scrolling.** It must arrest attention instantly through visual impact, not dense information.

### Style Enforcement

Each piece must respect its style's **hard constraints**:

| Constraint | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Whitespace % | Defines the breathing room—the silence between notes |
| Word limit | Forces economy—every word must earn its place |
| Element count | Prevents visual noise—simplicity is sophistication |
| Layout rules | Establishes spatial grammar—centered, asymmetric, grid |
| Typography weight | Sets the voice—whispered, conversational, commanding |

**If content exceeds constraints, reduce. Never violate the style. The constraints ARE the style.**

---

## Part 4: Execution Principles

### Visual Hierarchy

```
1. Single focal point per slide/card—the eye knows where to land
2. Clear reading order (F-pattern or Z-pattern)—the journey is intuitive
3. Contrast guides attention—importance is visible
4. Nothing competes with the message—supporting elements support
```

### Typography as Visual Element

```
- Headlines: Bold, commanding, minimal—a single powerful statement
- Body: Avoid entirely when possible—if you must, keep it whispered
- Numbers: Large, prominent, contextualized—let data be visual
- Labels: Small, quiet, supportive—they annotate, not explain
```

**Text is always minimal and visual-first.** Let context guide whether that means whisper-quiet labels or bold typographic gestures. A pitch deck might have larger, more aggressive type than a meditation app. Regardless of approach, sophistication is non-negotiable.

### Color Application

```
- Use brand palette or selected alternative palette exclusively
- Primary: 60% of color usage—the dominant voice
- Secondary: 30% of color usage—the supporting harmony
- Accent: 10% for emphasis only—the punctuation
- Never introduce off-brand colors—consistency builds trust
```

### Spatial Communication

```
- Whitespace is not empty—it's active, meaningful silence
- Placement carries meaning—center = importance, edges = supporting
- Proportion creates rhythm—vary scale intentionally
- Margins are sacred—nothing touches edges, nothing overlaps
```

---

## Part 5: Anti-Patterns (Death to These)

- **Bullet point lists**: The death of visual communication
- **Wall of text**: Violates the 3-second rule, breaks the visual contract
- **Clip art or stock clichés**: Instant amateur signal
- **Competing focal points**: Confusion disguised as richness
- **Decoration without purpose**: If it doesn't serve the message, delete it
- **Violating whitespace minimums**: Cramped = desperate
- **Exceeding word limits**: Discipline defines mastery
- **Generic template feel**: The opposite of everything we're doing

---

## Part 6: The Final Polish

**IMPORTANT**: Before declaring done, assume the user already said: "It isn't perfect enough. It must be pristine, a masterpiece of craftsmanship, as if it were about to be displayed in a museum."

**CRITICAL**: To refine the work, avoid adding more elements. Instead, refine what exists and make it extremely crisp. Rather than adding a new graphic or changing a font, ask: **"How can I make what's already here more of a piece of art?"**

Take a second pass:
- Check every alignment
- Verify every spacing decision
- Confirm nothing overlaps
- Ensure breathing room between all elements
- Polish until it gleams

---

## Part 7: Technical Implementation

This section provides the technical foundation for generating visual output.

### Asset Preparation

**Before generating any visual content**, prepare assets for PDF embedding:

#### SVG to PNG Conversion

SVG logos and images must be converted to PNG for reliable PDF embedding:

```python
# Using cairosvg (recommended for quality)
import cairosvg

cairosvg.svg2png(
    url="assets/logo.svg",
    write_to="assets/logo.png",
    output_width=800,  # Scale up for crisp rendering
    output_height=None  # Maintain aspect ratio
)

# Or using Inkscape CLI
# inkscape assets/logo.svg --export-filename=assets/logo.png --export-width=800
```

**Why PNG over JPG?**
- PNG preserves transparency (essential for logos)
- PNG is lossless (no compression artifacts)
- JPG only for photographs where file size matters

**Save converted assets in the same folder** as the source SVG for easy reference.

#### Font Handling

Fonts are loaded from two locations (in priority order):

1. **Project fonts**: `{PROJECT_PATH}/assets/fonts/` - Custom brand fonts uploaded by user
2. **System fonts**: Standard fonts available on the system

```python
from reportlab.pdfbase import pdfmetrics
from reportlab.pdfbase.ttfonts import TTFont
import os

def load_brand_fonts(project_path):
    """Load custom fonts from project assets."""
    fonts_dir = os.path.join(project_path, "assets", "fonts")

    if os.path.exists(fonts_dir):
        for font_file in os.listdir(fonts_dir):
            if font_file.endswith(('.ttf', '.otf')):
                font_name = os.path.splitext(font_file)[0]
                font_path = os.path.join(fonts_dir, font_file)
                try:
                    pdfmetrics.registerFont(TTFont(font_name, font_path))
                    print(f"Loaded font: {font_name}")
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Failed to load {font_file}: {e}")

# Load fonts before generating PDF
load_brand_fonts("/path/to/project")
```

### PDF Generation with reportlab

#### Presentation Slide (1920x1080)

```python
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import landscape
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.units import inch
from reportlab.lib.colors import HexColor

# Presentation dimensions
SLIDE_WIDTH = 1920
SLIDE_HEIGHT = 1080
SLIDE_SIZE = (SLIDE_WIDTH, SLIDE_HEIGHT)

def create_presentation_pdf(output_path, slides_content, brand_colors, logo_path):
    """Generate multi-page presentation PDF."""
    c = canvas.Canvas(output_path, pagesize=SLIDE_SIZE)

    # Parse brand colors
    primary = HexColor(brand_colors['primary'])
    secondary = HexColor(brand_colors['secondary'])
    text_color = HexColor(brand_colors['text'])
    bg_color = HexColor(brand_colors['background'])

    for slide in slides_content:
        # Background
        c.setFillColor(bg_color)
        c.rect(0, 0, SLIDE_WIDTH, SLIDE_HEIGHT, fill=True, stroke=False)

        # Safe zones: 50px from edges
        safe_left = 50
        safe_right = SLIDE_WIDTH - 50
        safe_top = SLIDE_HEIGHT - 50
        safe_bottom = 50

        # Headline (positioned in top third)
        c.setFillColor(text_color)
        c.setFont("Helvetica-Bold", 72)
        c.drawString(safe_left, safe_top - 100, slide['headline'])

        # Logo (bottom right, respecting safe zone)
        if logo_path:
            logo_width = 150
            logo_height = 60  # Adjust based on actual logo
            logo_x = safe_right - logo_width
            logo_y = safe_bottom + 20
            c.drawImage(logo_path, logo_x, logo_y,
                       width=logo_width, height=logo_height,
                       preserveAspectRatio=True, mask='auto')

        c.showPage()  # Next slide

    c.save()
```

#### Carousel Card (1080x1350)

```python
# LinkedIn carousel dimensions
CARD_WIDTH = 1080
CARD_HEIGHT = 1350
CARD_SIZE = (CARD_WIDTH, CARD_HEIGHT)

def create_carousel_pdf(output_path, cards_content, brand_colors, logo_path):
    """Generate multi-page carousel PDF."""
    c = canvas.Canvas(output_path, pagesize=CARD_SIZE)

    primary = HexColor(brand_colors['primary'])
    text_color = HexColor(brand_colors['text'])
    bg_color = HexColor(brand_colors['background'])

    for card in cards_content:
        # Background
        c.setFillColor(bg_color)
        c.rect(0, 0, CARD_WIDTH, CARD_HEIGHT, fill=True, stroke=False)

        # Safe zones: 5% from edges (mobile-friendly)
        margin = CARD_WIDTH * 0.05
        safe_left = margin
        safe_right = CARD_WIDTH - margin
        safe_top = CARD_HEIGHT - margin
        safe_bottom = margin

        # Headline (large, bold, thumb-stopping)
        c.setFillColor(text_color)
        c.setFont("Helvetica-Bold", 64)

        # Center text horizontally
        text_width = c.stringWidth(card['headline'], "Helvetica-Bold", 64)
        x = (CARD_WIDTH - text_width) / 2
        c.drawString(x, CARD_HEIGHT * 0.6, card['headline'])

        c.showPage()

    c.save()
```

### Color Application from Brand Philosophy

```python
def parse_brand_colors(brand_philosophy_path):
    """Extract colors from brand-philosophy.md."""
    # Read the markdown file and parse the colors table
    # Returns dict: {'primary': '#XXXXXX', 'secondary': '#XXXXXX', ...}

    colors = {}
    with open(brand_philosophy_path, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Parse the color table (simplified - real implementation uses regex)
    # Look for lines like: | Primary | Blue | #3B82F6 | ... |
    import re
    color_pattern = r'\|\s*(Primary|Secondary|Tertiary|Text|Background)\s*\|[^|]+\|\s*(#[A-Fa-f0-9]{6})\s*\|'

    for match in re.finditer(color_pattern, content):
        role = match.group(1).lower()
        hex_code = match.group(2)
        colors[role] = hex_code

    return colors
```

### Positioning Patterns

#### Centered Layout (Ma, Minimal styles)

```python
def position_centered(canvas, text, font, size, y_position, canvas_width):
    """Center text horizontally on canvas."""
    text_width = canvas.stringWidth(text, font, size)
    x = (canvas_width - text_width) / 2
    canvas.setFont(font, size)
    canvas.drawString(x, y_position, text)
```

#### Asymmetric Layout (Dramatic, Iki styles)

```python
def position_asymmetric(canvas, text, font, size, canvas_width, canvas_height):
    """Position text with dynamic tension (rule of thirds)."""
    # Left third anchor point
    x = canvas_width * 0.1
    y = canvas_height * 0.67  # Upper third
    canvas.setFont(font, size)
    canvas.drawString(x, y, text)
```

#### Grid Layout (Swiss style)

```python
def create_grid(canvas_width, canvas_height, columns=12, rows=8):
    """Create Swiss-style grid coordinates."""
    col_width = canvas_width / columns
    row_height = canvas_height / rows

    def grid_pos(col, row):
        return (col * col_width, canvas_height - (row * row_height))

    return grid_pos
```

### Output Process

#### Phase 1: Generate PDF (Source of Truth)

```python
# Full workflow
def generate_visual_content(
    canvas_philosophy,
    style_constraints,
    content_outline,
    brand_philosophy_path,
    output_format,  # 'presentation' or 'carousel'
    output_path
):
    # 1. Load brand assets
    colors = parse_brand_colors(brand_philosophy_path)
    logo_path = get_logo_path(brand_philosophy_path)
    load_brand_fonts(os.path.dirname(brand_philosophy_path))

    # 2. Convert SVG logo if needed
    if logo_path and logo_path.endswith('.svg'):
        png_path = logo_path.replace('.svg', '.png')
        convert_svg_to_png(logo_path, png_path)
        logo_path = png_path

    # 3. Generate PDF based on format
    if output_format == 'presentation':
        create_presentation_pdf(output_path, content_outline, colors, logo_path)
    else:
        create_carousel_pdf(output_path, content_outline, colors, logo_path)

    return output_path
```

#### Phase 2: Convert to PPTX (For Editability)

Use the `pptx` skill after PDF generation:
- Maintains design from PDF
- Creates editable text boxes
- Allows user modifications
- Presentations only (carousels stay as PDF)

---

## Workflow Integration

This skill is called by:
- `/template-presentation` - Generate sample.pdf + sample.pptx
- `/template-carousel` - Generate sample.pdf
- `/presentation` - Generate final presentation
- `/presentation-quick` - Generate final presentation (fast path)
- `/carousel` - Generate final carousel
- `/carousel-quick` - Generate final carousel (fast path)

## Input Requirements

When invoking this skill, provide:

1. **Canvas philosophy content** (from template's canvas-philosophy.md)
2. **Style enforcement block** (from style-constraints.md)
3. **Content outline** (slide/card content to render)
4. **Brand philosophy** (colors, fonts, logo from brand-philosophy.md)
5. **Output format** (presentation or carousel)
6. **Dimensions** (based on content type)

---

## The Ultimate Test

Before finalizing, ask:

> Would this work hang in a design museum?
> Would a creative director approve this for a premium client?
> Does every pixel serve the message?
> Does it look like someone labored over it with painstaking care?

If yes to all four, the work is ready.

If no to any, return to Part 6 and polish until it gleams.
