# Canvas Philosophy: [Template Name]

## Design Movement Name
**"[Creative Name]"** - [2-3 word description]

Example names by style:
- Minimal: "Silent Precision", "Breathed Space", "Refined Restraint"
- Dramatic: "Bold Impact", "Striking Asymmetry", "Commanding Presence"
- Organic: "Warm Authenticity", "Natural Flow", "Human Connection"

## Philosophy Statement

[4-6 paragraphs describing the visual philosophy. This is a manifesto for the design approach, not a specification. It should guide visual expression while leaving room for creative interpretation.]

**Paragraph 1 - Core Vision:**
[Describe the fundamental visual approach and what it represents. What feeling should viewers have?]

**Paragraph 2 - Space and Form:**
[Describe how space is used. Generous margins? Dramatic white space? Structured grids? Organic flow?]

**Paragraph 3 - Color and Material:**
[Describe color philosophy. Bold contrast? Subtle gradients? Monochromatic? How do brand colors manifest?]

**Paragraph 4 - Scale and Rhythm:**
[Describe size relationships. Large headlines with whispered body text? Consistent sizing? Dynamic variation?]

**Paragraph 5 - Composition and Balance:**
[Describe layout principles. Asymmetrical tension? Centered calm? Rule of thirds? Grid-based precision?]

**Paragraph 6 - Craftsmanship:**
[Emphasize quality. This work should appear meticulously crafted, labored over with care, the product of deep expertise and countless hours of refinement.]

## Brand Integration
