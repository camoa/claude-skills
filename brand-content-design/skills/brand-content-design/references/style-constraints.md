# Style Constraints

Three distinct visual styles based on Japanese Zen aesthetics. Each style is fully Zen-compliant but produces fundamentally different visual results.

---

## Style Overview

| Style | Zen Foundation | Visual Character | Best For |
|-------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| **Minimal** | Kanso + Seijaku | Maximum whitespace, single focal point, profound silence | Executive, data-driven, technical |
| **Dramatic** | Datsuzoku + Fukinsei | Asymmetrical layouts, bold contrast, visual tension | Pitch decks, announcements, creative |
| **Organic** | Shizen + Yugen | Natural flow, subtle depth, warm humanity | Storytelling, education, wellbeing |

---

## Minimal Style

### Philosophy
Based on **Kanso** (simplicity) and **Seijaku** (tranquil stillness). Every element must earn its place. What you remove is as important as what you keep. The goal is profound clarity through absence.

### Constraint Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Whitespace | 60-70% of slide | HARD LIMIT - reject if below 60% |
| Max words/slide | 8 | HARD LIMIT - truncate or split |
| Max elements/slide | 3 | HARD LIMIT - combine or remove |
| Color count | 3 maximum | HARD LIMIT - no exceptions |

### Layout Rules
- **Alignment**: Center all primary elements OR single strong left alignment
- **Grid**: Strict 8-point grid, no exceptions
- **Focal point**: ONE clear focal point per slide, positioned at optical center
- **Spacing**: Uniform, generous margins (minimum 10% of slide on all sides)
- **Balance**: Perfect symmetry OR strong intentional asymmetry (no "almost centered")

### Typography
- **Weight**: Light to Regular (300-400)
- **Scale ratio**: 1.2x (minor third) - tight, elegant progression
- **Headline size**: 48-56pt
- **Body size**: 18-24pt
- **Line height**: 1.2-1.3 (tight, formal)
- **Alignment**: Center or clean left-aligned blocks

### Image Treatment
- **Placement**: Centered or full-bleed only
- **Style**: Clean, high-contrast, graphic
- **Cropping**: Simple geometric crops, no complex shapes
- **Quantity**: One image maximum per slide (excluding logo)

### Color Application
- **Background**: Neutral (white, off-white, light gray) or single brand color
- **Text**: High contrast to background
- **Accent**: Single accent color, used sparingly (10% maximum)
- **Gradients**: None or extremely subtle

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)
- Multiple competing focal points
- Decorative elements without function
- More than 3 colors on any slide
- Bullet points (use visual hierarchy instead)
- Drop shadows or 3D effects
- Complex icons or illustrations
- Centered AND left-aligned elements on same slide

### Example Description
> A white slide with generous margins. A single large headline in light weight sits at optical center. Below it, a thin accent line in brand color. One supporting line of text in small, muted type. 65% of the slide is empty. The emptiness IS the design.

---

## Dramatic Style

### Philosophy
Based on **Datsuzoku** (freedom from convention) and **Fukinsei** (asymmetry/irregularity). Break expected patterns intentionally. Create visual tension that commands attention. Impact through controlled chaos.

### Constraint Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Whitespace | 35-45% of slide | HARD LIMIT - reject if below 35% |
| Max words/slide | 12 | HARD LIMIT - truncate or split |
| Max elements/slide | 5 | HARD LIMIT - prioritize impact elements |
| Color count | 4-5 | Use full range for contrast |

### Layout Rules
- **Alignment**: Asymmetrical, intentionally off-center
- **Grid**: Intentional grid breaks (element crosses grid line for tension)
- **Focal point**: Strong focal with supporting elements in tension
- **Spacing**: Varied - tight groupings against open space
- **Balance**: Dynamic equilibrium through unequal weights

### Typography
- **Weight**: Bold to Black (700-900)
- **Scale ratio**: 1.5x (perfect fifth) - dramatic size jumps
- **Headline size**: 56-72pt (larger than other styles)
- **Body size**: 14-20pt (smaller for contrast)
- **Line height**: 1.3-1.4 (spacious)
- **Alignment**: Ragged, asymmetrical, sometimes overlapping images

### Image Treatment
- **Placement**: Asymmetrical, off-edge, dramatic crops
- **Style**: High contrast, B&W with color accent, or saturated
- **Cropping**: Dramatic crops that extend beyond frame (120-150% bleed)
- **Quantity**: Can layer 2-3 images if creating intentional composition

### Color Application
- **Background**: Deep/dark (charcoal, navy, black) OR stark white
- **Text**: Maximum contrast to background
- **Accent**: Vibrant, saturated accent colors (complementary for pop)
- **Gradients**: Bold gradients allowed if they create drama

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)
- Perfect centering of all elements
- Uniform spacing throughout
- Muted, desaturated color palettes
- Small, timid headlines
- Symmetrical layouts
- Safe, predictable element placement
- All elements aligned to same grid

### Example Description
> A deep navy slide. A massive bold headline positioned high and left, breaking the expected center. Below it, a vibrant cyan accent element creates tension against the dark. An image bleeds off the right edge, cropped dramatically. The asymmetry is intentional, the contrast is striking, the impact is immediate.

## Organic Style

### Philosophy
Based on **Shizen** (naturalness) and **Yugen** (hidden depth). Design should feel unforced, like it grew naturally. Warmth and humanity over clinical precision. Subtle complexity beneath apparent simplicity.

### Constraint Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Whitespace | 50-60% of slide | HARD LIMIT - reject if below 50% |
| Max words/slide | 10 | HARD LIMIT - truncate or split |
| Max elements/slide | 4 | HARD LIMIT - keep flowing and connected |
| Color count | 5-6 (warm palette) | Allow variation within warm spectrum |

### Layout Rules
- **Alignment**: Natural groupings, organic flow
- **Grid**: Loose 8-point grid with organic alignments
- **Focal point**: Clear but integrated with supporting elements
- **Spacing**: Gentle progression, breathing room
- **Balance**: Natural equilibrium, like objects on a table

### Typography
- **Weight**: Medium to SemiBold (400-600)
- **Scale ratio**: 1.35x (augmented second) - gentle progression
- **Headline size**: 48-60pt
- **Body size**: 18-22pt
- **Line height**: 1.4-1.5 (generous breathing room)
- **Alignment**: Organic raggedness, natural text flow

### Image Treatment
- **Placement**: Natural, integrated with text flow
- **Style**: Documentary, authentic, warm tones
- **Cropping**: Soft, natural frames (can include subtle rounded corners)
- **Quantity**: One primary with optional subtle supporting elements

### Color Application
- **Background**: Warm neutrals (cream, warm gray, soft beige)
- **Text**: Warm darks (not pure black - use charcoal or brown-black)
- **Accent**: Earth tones, warm pastels, muted but present
- **Gradients**: Subtle, natural transitions allowed

### Texture
- **Background texture**: Subtle paper, linen, or organic texture at 3-5% opacity
- **Image treatment**: Slight warmth filter, natural grain acceptable
- **Borders**: Soft, organic (not sharp geometric)

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)
- Stark black and white contrast
- Rigid grid alignment throughout
- Cold, clinical color palettes
- Sharp geometric shapes
- Perfect symmetry
- High-contrast drop shadows
- Pure white backgrounds

### Example Description
> A warm cream slide with barely visible paper texture. A headline in warm charcoal sits naturally off-center, with a soft earth-tone accent beneath. A documentary-style image integrates with the text, edges soft. Supporting text flows naturally below. Everything feels connected, human, like a well-curated page in a quality book.

*All styles remain Zen-compliant through restraint - the difference is HOW restraint manifests visually.*
