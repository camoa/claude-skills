# Presentations Guide

Content type guide for creating presentations. Based on Presentation Zen principles.

---

## Zen Foundation

### Three Guiding Principles

**Restraint (Kanso)**
- Eliminate all nonessential elements
- Exercise discipline in what you include
- Less is exponentially more effective
- Challenge yourself to reduce content by 50%, then reduce again

**Simplicity**
- Simplicity is the essence of clear communication
- Think communication, not decoration
- Design is about making things clear with economy

**Naturalness**
- Authentic delivery that connects with audiences
- Organic flow that feels conversational
- The act of presenting is analog, not digital

### Signal-to-Noise Ratio

- **Signal** = your message
- **Noise** = everything else (clutter, decoration)
- Get rid of anything that doesn't support the message
- Principle: Amplification through simplification

### Critical Distinction

> "Slides are slides. Documents are documents. They aren't the same thing."

**Best slides are virtually meaningless without narration.** The presenter brings the content to life. Slides support the speaker, they don't replace the speaker.

## Slide Types

### Title Slide
- **Purpose**: Set context, make first impression
- **Content**: Title, subtitle, presenter (minimal)
- **Visual**: Strong visual impact, bold and simple
- **Words**: Under 10

### Content Slide
- **Purpose**: Convey one key idea
- **Content**: One concept, expressed visually when possible
- **Visual**: Clear focal point, generous white space
- **Words**: 10-20 maximum

### Image Slide
- **Purpose**: Visual storytelling, emotional connection
- **Variants**:
  - Full-bleed: Image fills slide, text overlay
  - With space: Image with generous margins
  - Split screen: Image 60-70%, text 30-40%
- **Words**: 5-10 (labels or headline only)

### Data/Chart Slide
- **Purpose**: Communicate one insight from data
- **Content**: ONE chart, ONE insight
- **Visual**: Simplified chart, highlight key point
- **Words**: Headline + data labels only
- **Rule**: Remove chart junk, use direct labeling

### Quote Slide
- **Purpose**: Add authority, inspiration, emphasis
- **Content**: Quote text + attribution
- **Visual**: Prominent quote, generous space
- **Words**: Quote length + 5-10 for attribution

### CTA Slide
- **Purpose**: Bridge content to action
- **Content**: Clear direction, reason to act, easy next step
- **Visual**: Uncluttered, single focus
- **Words**: 10-15

### Transition Slide
- **Purpose**: Signal section changes
- **Content**: Section title only
- **Visual**: Minimalist, breathing room
- **Words**: 3-5

---

## One Idea Per Slide

- Each slide should make one clear point
- Audience should understand in 3 seconds
- Multiple ideas create confusion
- Force yourself to separate complex ideas

**The 3-Second Test**: Will your audience understand the main point in 3 seconds or less?

---

## Visual Hierarchy

**Implementation**:
- **Size**: Important elements larger
- **Weight**: Bold for key message
- **Color**: Contrast guides attention
- **Position**: Most important at visual center or top
- **Space**: White space around key elements

**Rule**: One clear focal point per slide

---

## Typography

### Minimum Sizes (Projected)
- Title text: 36-44 points
- Body text: 24-32 points
- Captions: 18-20 points

### Guidelines
- Limit to 2-3 font sizes per slide
- Use weight (bold vs regular) for emphasis
- Limit to 2 font families maximum
- Sans-serif often works better for projection

**Rule**: If you can't read it easily, it's too small

---

## White Space

> "Nothing in your slide should be superfluous."

- Empty space is NOT wasted space
- White space amplifies key messages
- Creates breathing room for the eye
- Provides professional, premium feel

**Anti-Pattern**: Feeling compelled to fill every available space

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Bullet Point Overuse
- Bullet-filled slides become barriers
- Audiences read ahead instead of listening
- Creates boring, predictable presentations
- **Solution**: Strip to minimum, express visually

### Text-Heavy Slides
- Impossible to read and listen simultaneously
- Presenter becomes superfluous
- **Solution**: Best slides meaningless without narration

### Reading from Slides
- Insults audience intelligence
- Destroys presenter credibility
- **Solution**: Know content, look at audience

### Default Templates
- Generic, corporate appearance
- Signals lack of effort
- **Solution**: Start with blank slides, design for content

---

## Template Structures

### Technical Presentation (6-10 slides)
1. Title (visual impact, value proposition)
2. Problem (single clear problem)
3. Solution Overview (visual diagram)
4. Key Features (one per slide, 3-4 slides)
5. Proof/Case Study (data + story)
6. CTA/Next Steps

### Sales Deck (8-10 slides)
1. Cover (visual impact, value offer)
2. Problem (relatable pain point)
3. Solution (visual, minimal text)
4. Benefits (outcomes, not features)
5. Social proof (customer story)
6. How it works (simple visual)
7. Pricing (clear, clean)
8. CTA (specific next step)

### Educational Presentation (8-12 slides)
1. Hook (problem or promise)
2-8. Teaching points (one per slide, visual)
9. Key takeaway (visual summary)
10. CTA
