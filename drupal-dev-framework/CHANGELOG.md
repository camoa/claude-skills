## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-06

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Phases now apply to TASKS, not projects (aligns with drupal_development_guide.md)
- Projects contain requirements (gathered once) + multiple tasks
- Each task independently goes through Research → Architecture → Implementation
- Multiple tasks can be in `in_progress/` simultaneously

### Updated
- project-orchestrator: Now manages tasks, asks "What task do you want to work on?" after requirements
- phase-detector: Detects phase per task file, not per project
- requirements-gatherer: Transitions to task definition after requirements complete
- project_state.md template: Uses "Current Implementation Task" / "Up Next" / "Completed" format
- /next command: Task-aware decision logic

### Added
- Project registry system at `~/.claude/drupal-dev-framework/active_projects.json`
- project-initializer now registers projects on creation
- session-resume lists registered projects for easy selection
- memory-manager maintains registry

## [1.1.4] - 2025-12-06

### Added
- Project type question in requirements-gatherer (new module vs existing vs core issue)
- Auto-trigger rules in guide-integrator for automatic guide loading based on keywords
- Architecture principles validation (Library-First, CLI-First, SOLID) in architecture-validator
- Step 10 in project-initializer to direct users to `/next` command

### Fixed
- `/new` command now directs to `/next` instead of listing manual commands
- Aligned plugin with drupal_development_guide.md requirements
